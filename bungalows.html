							There&#8217;s a quiet charm about this hill station. A certain romanticism persists as one evokes the era of the early 20th century, when the vistas below was nothing but an endless green swath of rainforest trees, which until the 1930s blanketed most of the island and the mainland. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The only way up and down the hill in 1890s was by pony or sedan. Visitors to Penang Hill would trek to the Botanical Gardens at the foothill, take in the sights at the waterfall before embarking on the uphill trek. 
						</p>
						<p>
							From the <a href="http://www.penang-traveltips.com/botanical-gardens-waterfall.htm">Botanical Gardens Waterfall</a>, a narrow road led up the hilltop. It is said that <a href="http://www.penang-traveltips.com/biography-of-captain-francis-light.htm">Captain Francis Light</a> was the first to plot a horse track up Penang Hill, way back in 1788. Later there was a pony and sedan service to carry people and supplies up the hill. The charge for a pony was $1.50; and 35 cents for a chair porter. Typically five to eight porters were required for each chair and the services of this sedan were normally required by the young, the women, and the infirm. The walk up took roughly 2-3 hours. With the jungle canopy and the gradual drop in temperature as they ascended towards the 821m peaks, the climb was probably bearable. There really wasn&#8217;t much for the early visitors to do except nature trekking, a stroll around the beautiful gardens that was later landscaped to look just like gardens back in Britain, a game of croquet, reading, painting and just to take in the wonderful views. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Penang Hill is the oldest hill station in Malaysia, and possibly the first hill station built in the British colonies, pre-dating the larger hill stations in India such as Simla  from the 1820s. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Penang Island was known as the Prince of Wales Island and Penang Hill was called Government Hill. It straddles several peaks, but the main peak where the Governor&#8217;s bungalow is located was called Flagstaff Hill. It was so named because a flag was hoisted up to alert the community living below in Georgetown of any pending dangers and more importantly - to signal the arrival of the mail boat from Britain, probably the most important cargo for the small colonial society living in the far flung outposts. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Despite its newfound interest, the resident British population was around 300; and the hill station remained small and personal. Unfamiliar with the tropical conditions and the harshness of the Malayan jungles, there was certainly demand for quiet, tranquil resorts to convalesce. It was cool, less humid, and most of all, free from malaria. Although the temperature on Penang Hill was only about 6&deg;C cooler, there were improvements in some patients arriving from the lowlands. Indeed, a convalescent centre was built for the officers of the British East India Company. The Hill saw some busy times from 1800 to 1820 when more military officers and civil servants were posted to Penang.
						</p>
						<p>
							Soon, Government departments were building hill bungalows for their senior officials. These are found mostly around the eastern slopes. The northern part of Penang Hill remains intact, being designated as water catchment areas.

							Penang Hill&#8217;s Bungalows are a legacy of Penang&#8217;s history. The earlier ones were built by the British. This was in the 19th century. The British administrators earmarked for themselves the choicest land on Penang Hill. Many who made their homes on Penang Hill were British officers. 
						</p>
						<p>
							A bungalow in the 1800s referred to temporary hill dwellings used by Europeans. Dwellings of more permanence in the lowlands were called houses or residences. The early bungalow was described as one-storeyed, low ceilinged buildings that were mostly square or oblong. The early structures sat on slightly raised platforms. The walls were made of mud or covered with woven mats and roofed with attap. A veranda ran round the house where guests could sit, enjoying the evening vistas from any angle. Shaded from the afternoon sun by bamboo blinds, sipping English tea or Whisky stengahs was a ritual. The interior had an open area where the living and dining area was located and from this, doors led to bedrooms along both sides. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The early bungalows were later replaced or reconstructed into brick structures. The Government bungalows on the hill stations of Penang Hill, Fraser&#8217;s Hill and Cameron Highlands bore many similarities of architecture and structures; and many are still standing today.
						</p>
						<p>
							By the third quarter of the 19th century, particularly after the discovery of rich tin deposits across on the mainland, many of the local Chinese became the newly rich. There was no better way to show off that you have arrived than to build a bungalow on Penang Hill. In the early stages, the Chinese tycoons were forbidden to own or build properties on the highest level of the hill, so they built theirs below existing properties. Many of these were given decidedly Western names, for example Mon Sejour, Dolce Domum (now HIckory), Fairmont, Grace Dieu, etc.
						</p>
						<p>
							After Independence, the British bungalows were taken over by the local government, but continue to carry their British names such as Bel Retiro, Richmond, Convalescent Bungalow, and so on. As development on Penang Hill is strictly controlled, the current stock of about 30 bungalows is tightly held. Transactions are rare.

It still remains the holiday residence of the Governor today. Building on the principle that proximity is next to greatness, the senior officers built their bungalows in proximity to Bel Retiro.

							The Crag was owned by a Scot, Captain Kerr. The famous Sarkies Brothers who also owned Eastern &amp; Oriental Hotel in Georgetown, Raffles Hotel in Singapore and The Strand in Rangoon acquired the Crag and converted it into a hotel in 1895. The hotel comprised of a &lsquo;cluster of bungalows&rsquo;; surrounding  a communal dining and lounge area.

							Apart from a brief use as the film set for the movie Indochine in 1991, the Crag Hotel site has not been used.

							The Sarkies Brothers are ethnic Armenians who hailed from Isfahan, Iran. They arrived in Southeast Asia at the fourth quarter of the 19th century. There were four of them: Martin (1852-1912), Tigran (1861-1912), Aviet (1862-1923) and Arshak (1868-1931). They were involved in various trades but were not yet into the hotel line.
						</p>
						<p>
							The idea to go into the hotel business came about in 1885, when they met the <a href="http://www.asiaexplorers.com/thailand/khaorang.htm">Khaw family</a>, who had their hands in various enterprises all the way between Penang and <a href="http://www.asiaexplorers.com/thailand/bangkok_travel_guide.htm">Bangkok</a>. Seeing that the hotel industry may be more profitable than his auctioneering business, 23-year-old Tigran rented a large bungalow at 1A <a href="http://www.penang-traveltips.com/light-street.htm">Light Street</a>, Penang, and named it the Eastern Hotel. It opened to guests on 15 April, 1884.
						</p>
						<p>
							Seeing how well the business was running, eldest brother Martin joined in. Together, calling themselves the Sarkies Brothers, they bought the Hôtel de l&#8217;Europe, located on the seafront of <a href="http://www.penang-traveltips.com/farquhar-street.htm">Farquhar Street</a>, and renamed it the Eastern & Oriental Hotel. Brother No. 3, Aviet, was persuaded to climb on board, and he became the Manager.
						</p>
						<p>
							Even as the hotel business took off, the brothers were scouting for other premises. In 1887, they found a large bungalow at the junction of <a href="http://www.singapore-traveltips/beach-road.htm">Beach Road</a> and <a href="http://www.singapore-traveltips/bras-basah-road.htm">Bras Basah Road</a> in <a href="http://www.singapore-traveltips/">Singapore</a>. It belonged to the famous Arab trader Mohamad Alsagoff. The bungalow had previously been used as a hostel for the boys studying at Raffles Institution. Borrowing the Raffles name, the Sarkies opened the <a href="http://www.singapore-traveltips.com/raffles-hotel.htm">Raffles Hotel</a> in December, 1887.
						</p>
						<p>
							Within the next few years, they blazed a trail through Southeast Asia, opening the Kartika Wijaya Hotel in Batu, East Java, Indonesia in 1891; the Strand Hotel in <a href="http://www.asiaexplorers.com/myanmar/yangon_travel_guide.htm">Rangon (now Yangon)</a>, <a href="http://www.asiaexplorers.com/myanmar_travel_guide.htm">Myanmar</a> in 1901; and Hotel Oranje (now Hotel Majapahit Mandarin Oriental) in Surabaya, <a href="http://www.asiaexplorers.com/indonesia_travel_guide.htm">Indonesia</a> in 1910.

						Strawberry Hill is on a hillock immediately above Upper Station. It was thought that its first owner, David Brown, grew strawberries there.
					</p>
					<p>
						David Brown was a contemporary of <a href="http://www.penang-traveltips.com/biography-of-captain-francis-light.htm">Captain Francis Light</a>. On his estates he grew nutmeg as well as cloves & pepper. In addition to David Brown's Cottage, he also built Brown House and Mon Craig.
					</p>
					<p>
						David Brown's Cottage was a two-storey structure which was destroyed during WWII. In its place stood a single-storey building that was known to locals as the Tea Kiosk. In 2005 it was rebuilt to capture its former glory. It now houses an upmarket establishment called David Brown's Restaurant & Tea House. It's a place for English tea, scones, strawberry-and-cream, and where dressing up for dinner is de rigeuer. Its menu is steep with nostalgia for the colonial era.

						The cool climate of Penang Hill is ideal for setting up this exotic garden. The Monkey Cup Garden attempts to faithfully recreate the habitat of pitcher plants, some of which are found growing among mosses. Other plants found in the pitcher plant ecology, such as ferns, orchids and shrubs are also planted. The pitcher plant is often called monkey cup due to the notion that monkeys are fond of drinking from the pitchers. They are carnivorous plants with mechanisms to trap prey, mostly insects.
					</p>
					<p>
						Apart from the <i>Nepenthes</i>, other carnivorous plants are also grown here including the Venus Flytrap and the <i>Sarracenia</i>. Enthusiasts can also purchase pitcher plants at the garden shop. Books and other material related to pitcher plants are also on sale.
					</p>
					<p>
						The garden is located about 1.5 km from the Penang Hill Police Station and is signposted. To reach the garden, take the path off <a href="http://www.penang-traveltips.com/jalan-tuanku-yahya-petra.htm">Jalan Tuanku Yahya Petra</a> in front of Top Station.

						<p> 
							We are the 5th generation descendents of arrivals to Penang from Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in the late 19th Century, a part of a larger influx who arrived at the behest of the British colonial administration to assist in the development and administration of the land.
						</p>
						<p>
							Some worked for the Government of the day. Some were involved in the development of the country's infrastructure (transport, health, education). Still others opened up the hinterland for growing rubber, a commodity in great demand then. Our origins were in plantations and education.
							
							With each successive generation the family gradually dispersed far and wide across the Commonwealth.
						</p>
						<p>
							At Family gatherings, conversation usually gravitates towards the days of the earlier generations, and their lives and their achievements in Penang.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am Raj, the current owner of Hickory, and a member of the 4th generation. Through a series of fortunate events, Hickory has been placed under my care.  I have decided to renovate and convert Hickory into a bed and breakfast to preserve the historical significance of the building and of the lineage that has led to this moment.
						</p>
						<p>
							An excerpt from the book <i><a href="http://www.penangstory.net.my/mino-content-paperkarthigesu.html">The Penang Story</a></i> touches on the activities of 2 such individuals of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> generation arrivals (my great-grandfather and my grandfather, respectively):
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Other early arrivals were Mr. 'Brown' C.Cathiravelu, a well-known Ceylon Tamil entrepreneur who bought over Penang's famous E&amp;O Hotel just to prove a point and his son-in-law, Mr. 'Tanjong Bungah' K.Sinnatamby who was the owner of 100 acres of land in Tanjong Bungah which he later developed..."
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							Hickory replicates the atmosphere of a bygone era where the pace was slower and life more tranquil. It is also a focus for the diaspora to call Home.
						</p>
						<p>
							We hope to provide You with an experience far removed from the hustle and bustle of City life; a back-to-nature experience with long walks in the woods; and an atmosphere that encourages reading and writing, in a carefree, cooler and meditative setting.
						</p>
						<p>
							We invite you to Hickory to savour the solitude of nightfall and the splendour of daybreak on Penang Hill.
